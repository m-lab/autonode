# PROBABILITY is the probability that this node will be selected by M-Lab's
# load balancer. Tweak it according to how much traffic this node can handle.
# A probability of 1 (100%) means that this node will be equally as likely to
# be selected as any other M-Lab node in the same metro. Default is 0.1 (10%).

# For example: INTERFACE_MAXRATE=150000000
